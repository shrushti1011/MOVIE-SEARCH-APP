*Movie Search With AJ

This Movie Search App is a beginner-friendly React JS project that enables users to explore movies by title. It utilizes the power of the OMDb API for movie data retrieval,
offering features like searching for movies, displaying detailed information about selected films, and presenting a list of popular movies. With its responsive design, 
it adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes. This project serves as an excellent learning opportunity for newcomers to React and API integration, allowing them to build a 
functional movie search application from scratch.
MovieSearch With AJ is a feature-rich, responsive React application that allows users to search for movies and view detailed information fetched from a public movie database API like OMDb (Open Movie Database). This project was built as part of the CodTech internship to demonstrate skills in React development, API integration, UI design, and state management.

The app provides a clean and user-friendly interface where users can search for any movie by name, view results in a card-based layout, and optionally save favorite movies for future reference.



#Key Features
Movie Search: Users can enter the name of a movie to search and get real-time results fetched from the OMDb API.

Responsive UI: The app features a modern, responsive design that works seamlessly across devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

Dynamic Movie Cards: Results are displayed as visually appealing movie cards showing posters, titles, and additional details.

Favorites Feature: Users can save their favorite movies locally using browser storage (such as localStorage).

Loading & Error States: Displays loading spinners while fetching and error messages for invalid queries or failed responses.

Reusable Components: Modular React components are used to promote reusability and clean code structure.



#Technologies Used
React.js – For building the user interface using functional components and hooks.

OMDb API – For retrieving movie data like titles, posters, genres, and release dates.

JavaScript (ES6+) – Core language for logic and API calls.

CSS Modules – For modern and maintainable styling.

React Icons – For elegant iconography like the search icon.

localStorage – For persisting favorite movies across sessions.


#How It Works
User Search: The user enters a movie name into the input field.

API Call: The app sends a request to the OMDb API with the entered query.

Display Results: Results are fetched and rendered as movie cards dynamically.

Save Favorites : A user can click to add a movie to their list of favorites.
